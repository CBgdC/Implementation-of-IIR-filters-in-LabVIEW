# Implementation-of-IIR-filters-in-LabVIEW

In a college course, I had to implement the Infinite Impulse Response filters in the LabVIEW development environment. Following this project I gained knowledge about: types of signals, sampling frequencies, types of analog filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, stop-band), types of prototype IIR filters (Butterwort, Chebyshev, Inverse Chebysev, Bessel, Elliptic), cutoff frequencies and more.
